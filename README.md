## basic solution for an interview-question-style elevator implementation

input is in space-separated "hackerrank format":

* first line: n s

        where 
            n = number of requests(request = instance of button being pushed on a floor)
            s = starting floor (floor evelator is on at time 0)
        
* lines 0-n: t o d

        where 
            t = number of seconds after time 0 at which the request occurs
            o = originating floor of the request
            d = destination floor for the request
